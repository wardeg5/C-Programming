<h1>Getting Started Assignment</h1>
<p>This is your first graded assignment, and&#160;the only assignment that does not involve programming.&#160; The purpose of this assignment is to introduce yourself to the class and instructor, and provide information that can help us ensure your success in this course.&#160; You will upload 2 files to the Desire2Learn dropbox and then introduce yourself on the discussion board.</p>
<p>In this assignment the first thing you should do is create a&#160;text file (a Notepad document, <strong>not</strong> a Word document) that contains your answers to the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why are&#160;you taking CS 133U?</li>
<li>What type of programming experience do you have?</li>
<li>What type of system (Windows, Linux, Apple, etc.) will you use to develop programs?</li>
<li>What IDE (DevC++, Visual Studio, Xcode, etc.) will you use to develop programs?</li>
<li>List the assignments and their submission dates.</li>
<li>List the required exams and their end dates.</li>
<li>How long are the exams open? For a week? month? term?</li>
<li>How many attempts are you allowed for each mandatory exam? Which score counts towards your grade?</li>
<li>List all the places on Desire2Learn where the instructor might put assignment help for you? (hint: <a href="https://online.pcc.edu/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=98051&amp;type=discuss&amp;rCode=PCCD-484418" target="_blank">discussion is one of em)</a></li>
<li>What is the maximum total assignment (including the extra credit) score that you can achieve in this class?</li>
<li>When and where are the in<a href="../01%20Getting%20Started/Course%20Syllabus.html" target="_blank">structor&#39;s office hours?</a></li>
</ol>
<p>You should name your <strong>text</strong> file<strong><span class="codeFormat"> introduction.txt</span></strong> and upload it to the Introduction Assignment dropbox in Desire2Learn.&#160; It is important that you use the dropbox, and <strong>avoid emailing</strong> the assignent to the instructor.</p>
<p>The second thing you should do in this assignment is&#160;upload a digital photograph of yourself to the dropbox.&#160; Any photograph will do as long as it clearly shows your face&#160;and what you look like.&#160; The photograph will be treated as confidential student information, and will not be distributed to the class.&#160; The purpose of the photograph&#160;is to allow the instructor to recognize you if an in-person meeting is required, and for identification purposes if your class participation ever needs to be verified.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>When you complete this assignment there should be two files in the Desire2Learn dropbox: the <span class="codeFormat">introduction.txt</span> file and your digital photograph.</strong></span></p>
